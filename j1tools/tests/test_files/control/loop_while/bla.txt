        Grammar rule:
            loop_while: BEGIN block WHILE block REPEAT
            
        This transforms:
            BEGIN
                block1          ; First block executes unconditionally
            WHILE              ; Block1 leaves test condition on stack
                block2          ; Second block executes if condition is true
            REPEAT             ; Jump back to BEGIN
            next_instr
            
        Into:
            +begin_label:
            block1             ; First block code
            ZJMP exit_label    ; If condition is false, exit loop
            block2             ; Second block code
            JMP begin_label    ; Jump back to start unconditionally
            +exit_label:       ; Target for condition == false
            next_instr
